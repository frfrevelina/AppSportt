This sport app is going to help users to choose the most suitable sport training on the basis of initial data of the user, its wishes and aims. There will be recommendations given for choosing the best physical load in order to achieve the final goal (muscle growth (bodybuilding) / weight loss / stretching). This app will be able to analyze the current sport condition of the user and to propose a program for training as well as it will be possible to build its own training program for the user if wants.
The user creates its profile, if doesn't exist. Or the user logs in if the profile is already created. The profile contains information about the user: name, lastname, weight, gender, age, aim. After logging in the user chooses the program to use according to its aim: bodybuilding or weight looosing or stretching and selects the level of its physical load: beginner or medium or professional (Pro). In case the user wants to create its own program, it is also possible to do, choosing the 4th variant (individual program), where the user can choose exercises form the database.
The user has an opportunity to see and check its progress (by weight difference at the start and in the end of the training course).
